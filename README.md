## PathFinder

This project implements popular pathfinding algorithms on a 25x60 grid to find the shortest path between a designated start and end point while avoiding barriers (walls). The path-finding process is animated to illustrate the logic embedded in each algorithm.

### Inspiration

I beleived this project would be a good way to practice efficient algorithm implementation while also boosting my web development skills. The idea was inspired by Clement Mihailescu's Pathfinding Visualizer project [https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer]. While the idea is the same, the implementation of the algorthms and visualizer is unique.


### Future Goals

The next step for this project is to improve the appearance of the page. Once this is addressed, I hope to add one or two more algorithms to the pathfinder.
