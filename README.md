## PathFinder

This project implements Djikstra's algorithm on a 25x60 grid to find the shortest path between a designated start and end point. 

### Inspiration

The idea was inspired by Clement Mihailescu's Pathfinding Visualizer project [https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer-Tutorial]. While the idea is the same, the implementation of the algorthm and visualizer is unique.

### Future Goals

This initial commit has just the barebones to find a shortest path (without walls) and display the path and nodes visited by the algorithm.

The next thing to do is add walls and to incrementally display the visited nodes.
